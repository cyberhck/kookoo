## Passwordless Login

Passwordless login is a project which I'm doing for online kookoo api challenge. This project logs a user in without having to enter password.

The way it works is, it calls user's number to authorize a session.

## Using this application
First setup application properly.

To initialize tables structures, go to ```application_url/install``` (example: ```localhost/install```) which will execute tables in tables.sql file

Then signup for a new account at ```application_url/signup``` after account is created, login to your account at ```application_url/login```. Once you enter your email and click on login, you should see a pin on your screen and should a receive a call in number you registered with, answer the call and listen to pin very carefully, to authorize, press ```1``` then press ```#``` to reject a pin, press ```0``` then press ```#```. If you weren't expecting a call, you can just ignore the call.

Once you make a choice, call should automatically hangup.

## Release Information


This release is a Minimal Viable Product. Of course you are gonna want to change the entire thing to make use on your website, this project is only for demonstration of idea


## Server Requirements

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.


## Installation

Just clone the forked repository into root of your web server, then change the ```config.php``` file inside ```application/config/config.php``` there you'd have to change base_url as per your setup. Then you'll have to change ```database.php``` inside ```/application/config/database.php``` file. Change the development variable. Please don't modify other configs while pushing to this repository.

Also ```cp index.sample.php index.php``` and modify the contents in there, also make sure your development environment is set properly

In this project, for some reason, I wasn't able to get the base_url thing working with kookoo's API, so you will also have to modify ```application/helpers/call_helper.php``` to modify the ```$url_to_call``` variable to have proper application's url
